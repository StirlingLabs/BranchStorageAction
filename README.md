# üéã Branch Storage Action

> Store files on an orphan branch of a repo dedicated for static storage

## ‚≠ê Features

- Save files on a separate branch
- Specify a custom commit message on save
- Customize `storage-branch` name

## üöÄ Quickstart

```yaml
      # Generate an asset in your job. E.G: Download a badge image from shields.io
      - name: Download a badge file
        run: wget https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red
      
      # Store this asset in 'gh-storage' branch.
      - name: Save file in a new orphan storage branch
        uses: StirlingLabs/BranchStorageAction@main
        with:
          src: license-MIT-blue
          dst: legal/LICENSE
```

Badge generated in this action can then be referenced from your README or anywhere else...

The `src` and `dst` parameters are passed to `cp -r` so they can be a single file or full directory trees.
